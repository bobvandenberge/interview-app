# Coding Interview

Hi, welcome to the coding interview at Caple! We are going to write our own ```String::format``` method. You can find the specification in the ```Specification.feature``` file. 

To get started, please create a fork of this repository. When you are finished, please create a pull request to merge your implementation into the branch. 

Good luck!
